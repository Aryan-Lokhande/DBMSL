/* Alright, let's imagine a simple database with two tables: employees and salaries.
employees:
- id (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
- name (VARCHAR)
- department (VARCHAR)
- position (VARCHAR)

salaries:
- employee_id (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing employees.id)
- salary_amount (DECIMAL)
- currency (VARCHAR)
- date_paid (DATE) 
*/

-- 1.Pattern Matching:Query to select employees whose names start with 'J'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';

-- 2.Arithmetic Operations and Built-in Functions:Query to calculate the average salary
SELECT AVG(salary_amount) AS average_salary FROM salaries;

-- Query to calculate the total salary paid in USD
SELECT SUM(salary_amount) AS total_salary_usd FROM salaries WHERE currency = 'USD';
